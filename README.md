"#replica" 
This is a simple mock server for simulating REST services without effort.
Currently under development, May 2018

Features:
- plain json delivered on required uri
- simulated json full service (POST/PUT/GET/DELETE) based on JSON Schema

What's next:
- reverse proxy functionality for replacing mock with real services
- UI console for management
- log configuration for better input/output inspection
- some API Gateway functions for more advanced development
- packaged version (maybe single file if possible)
